# new-wave-agile-dev

## Introduction

Welcome to our project's README.md. This document serves as the central repository of information for our team's agile development process. Our project will adhere strictly to agile principles, using a Kanban board for tracking progress, visualizing workload, and ensuring continuous delivery.

<!-- ## Team Members

Member 1: [Role]
Member 2: [Role]
Member 3: [Role]
Roles are fluid and can change as we progress, aligning with the agile principle of self-organizing teams. -->

## Agile Process Overview

### Iterative Development

We will develop our software iteratively, with a focus on delivering incremental value with each iteration. Each iteration will last two weeks, at the end of which we will have a review meeting to assess the work done and plan the next iteration.

### Kanban Board

Our Kanban board will have the following columns:

-   Backlog
-   To Do
-   In Progress
-   Review
-   Done

All tasks will begin in the Backlog and move from left to right as they progress through our workflow. Our board will be updated daily to reflect the most current state of tasks.

### Stand-ups

Daily stand-up meetings will occur every morning at 9:00 AM. Each team member will briefly share what they did the day before, what they plan to do today, and any blockers they're facing.

### Sprint Planning

At the start of each sprint, we will hold a planning meeting to prioritize tasks from the backlog and move them into the To Do column. Each task will be assigned to a team member.

### Reviews and Retrospectives

At the end of each sprint, we will hold a review meeting to demonstrate what has been completed. Following the review, we will conduct a retrospective to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how we can improve.

## Workflow Rules

1. Work Limitation: To avoid bottlenecks, a limit on the number of tasks in the In Progress column will be set.

2. Definition of Done: A task is only considered done when it has been developed, tested, reviewed, and meets the acceptance criteria.

3. Blockers: Any blockers that cannot be resolved within the team must be escalated immediately.

## Communication

Team communication is vital. We will use [Communication Tool Name] for all project-related discussions. All team members are expected to be active and responsive during working hours.

## Version Control

We will use Git for version control, with the following branch structure:

main - stable release branch
develop - development branch
Feature branches as needed
Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.

## Documentation

All documentation will be written in Markdown and stored in the repository. This includes meeting notes, sprint retrospectives, and any other relevant information.

## Risk Management

We will identify potential risks early in the process and address them in our sprint retrospectives.

## Contribution Guidelines

Write clean, maintainable code.
Follow coding standards and best practices.
Ensure that all code is peer-reviewed.
Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
Update documentation as needed.
